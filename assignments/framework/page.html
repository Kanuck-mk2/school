    >
    <pre>
Once upon a time there were three bears, who lived together in a house of their own, in a wood. 
  
  One of them was a little wee bear, and one was a middle-sized bear, and the other was a great big bear.</pre
    >
    <h2>The Porriage Incident</h2>
    <pre>
One day, after they had made the porridge for their breakfast, and poured it into their porridge-bowls, they walked out into the wood while the porridge was cooling, that they might not burn their mouths by beginning too soon, for they were polite, well-brought-up Bears. 
  
  And while they were away a little girl called Goldilocks, who lived at the other side of the wood and had been sent on an errand by her mother, passed by the house, and looked in at the window. And then she peeped in at the keyhole, for she was not at all a well-brought-up little girl. And what did she see?</pre
    >
    <ul>
      <li>Three steaming bowls of porridge</li>
      <li>A wooden spoon</li>
      <li>A charming dining table</li>
    </ul>
    <pre>
Then seeing nobody in the house she lifted the latch. The door was not fastened, because the Bears were good Bears, who did nobody any harm, and never suspected that anybody would harm them.
  
  So Goldilocks opened the door and went in; and well pleased was she when she saw the porridge on the table. 
  
  If she had been a well-brought-up little girl she would have waited till the Bears came home, and then, perhaps, they would have asked her to breakfast; for they were good Bears—a little rough or so, as the manner of Bears is, but for all that very good-natured and hospitable. But she was an impudent, rude little girl, and so she set about helping herself.</pre
    >
    <ol>
      <li>First she tasted the porridge of the great big bear</li>
      <li>Next she tasted the porridge of the middle-sized bear</li>
      <li>And then she went to the porridge of the wee bear</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>A Place to Rest</h2>
    <pre>
Then Goldilocks, who was tired, for she had been catching butterflies instead of running on her errand, sat down in the chair of the Great Big Bear, but that was too hard for her. And then she sat down in the chair of the Middle-sized Bear, and that was too soft for her. But when she sat down in the chair of the Little Wee Bear, that was neither too hard nor too soft, but just right. So she seated herself in it, and there she sate till the bottom of the chair came out, and down she came, plump upon the ground; and that made her very cross, for she was a bad-tempered little girl. Now, being determined to rest, Goldilocks went upstairs into the bedchamber in which the Three Bears slept.</pre
    >
    <ol>
      <li>First she lay down upon the bed of the great big bear</li>
      <li>Next she layout down upon the bed of the middle-sized bear</li>
      <li>And then she lay down upon the bed of the little wee bear</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>The Bear's Return</h2>
    <pre>
  By this time the Three Bears thought their porridge would be cool enough for them to eat it properly; so they came home to breakfast. Now careless Goldilocks had left the spoon of the Great Big Bear standing in his porridge.
 
  “SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!”
  
  said the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.
  Then the Middle-sized Bear looked at his porridge and saw the spoon was standing in it too.
  
  
  “SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!”
  
  said the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.
  Then the Little Wee Bear looked at his, and there was the spoon in the porridge-bowl, but the porridge was all gone!
  
  “SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE, AND HAS EATEN IT ALL UP!”
  
  said the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.</pre
    >

    <h2>The Resolution</h2>
    <pre>
Now Goldilocks had heard in her sleep the great, rough, gruff voice of the Great Big Bear; but she was so fast asleep that it was no more to her than the roaring of wind, or the rumbling of thunder. And she had heard the middle-sized voice of the Middle-sized Bear, but it was only as if she had heard someone speaking in a dream. 
      
      But when she heard the little wee voice of the Little Wee Bear, it was so sharp, and so shrill, that it awakened her at once. Up she started, and when she saw the Three Bears on one side of the bed, she tumbled herself out at the other, and ran to the window. 
      
      Now the window was open, because the Bears, like good, tidy Bears, as they were, always opened their bedchamber window when they got up in the morning. So naughty, frightened little Goldilocks jumped; and whether she broke her neck in the fall, or ran into the wood and was lost there, or found her way out of the wood and got whipped for being a bad girl and playing truant, no one can say. But the Three Bears never saw anything more of her.</pre
