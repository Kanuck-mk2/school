                <h2>History of Hipsterism</h2>
                <p>
                    The term "hipster" has evolved over time, reflecting different
          cultural movements and social dynamics throughout the 20th and 21st
          centuries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, the term "hipster" is less commonly used to define a specific
          group but still invokes ideas of alternative culture, individualism,
          and a rejection of the mainstream—however, these ideas have also been
          absorbed into the broader culture.
                </p>

                    <h3>Early Hipsters: The 1940s</h3>
                    <section>
                        <h4>Origins in Jazz Culture</h4>
                        <p>
                            The early hipsters were heavily influenced by the jazz scene,
              particularly the African-American musicians who pioneered the
              genre. Jazz, with its improvisational and rebellious spirit,
              became a symbol of resistance against the rigid structures of
              society.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They were drawn to the bohemian, carefree lifestyle embodied by
              jazz legends like Miles Davis and Charlie Parker, who rejected
              mainstream success in favor of artistic freedom.

                        <h4>Style and Attitudes</h4>
                        <p>
                            Early hipsters embraced a bohemian lifestyle characterized by
              loose, casual clothing, a love for intellectualism, and a distaste
              for materialism. Their fashion choices and nonchalant attitudes
              set them apart from mainstream culture.

                            <h4>Expansion of Hipsterism</h4>
                            <p>
                                The Beats, led by figures like Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg,
                continued the hipster tradition by rejecting conventional
                society. They explored alternative spiritualities, experimented
                with drugs, and wrote about their disillusionment with American
                values.

                            <h3>Modern Hipsterism: 1990s to 2000s</h3>
                            <section>
                                <h4>Rebirth in Urban Centers</h4>
                                <p>
                                    By the 1990s, hipsterism resurfaced as a subculture in urban
                  environments. Modern hipsters gravitated towards indie music,
                  vintage clothing, and artisanal goods, often in reaction to
                  mass-market consumerism and corporate culture.
                                </p>
                                <h4>Commodification and Criticism</h4>
                                <p>
                                    As hipster culture gained popularity, it paradoxically became
                  commodified, leading to critiques of its elitism and its
                  irony-laden approach to culture. Despite this, hipsters
                  remained influential tastemakers in fashion, music, and media.
                                </p>
