        <h2>About Hipsters</h2>
        <p>
          A hipster is often defined as a subcultural figure who values
          independent thinking, counter-culture, and non-mainstream interests.
          The modern hipster movement took shape in the 2000s, especially among
          urban, young adults. Hipsters tend to gravitate toward alternative
          fashion, music, art, and lifestyles that emphasize creativity and
          individuality. Their distinct aesthetic often includes thrift-store
          clothing, vintage styles, and accessories that may seem ironic or
          retro, signaling a rejection of mass-market consumerism.

          <h3>History of Hipsterism</h3>
          <p>
            The origins of hipsterism can be traced back to the 1940s in the
            United States, where the term "hipster" was first used to describe
            jazz aficionados who adopted the laid-back, rebellious lifestyle of
            African-American jazz musicians. These early hipsters embraced the
            subversive spirit of jazz, which stood in contrast to the mainstream
            culture of the time, and were characterized by their bohemian
            attitudes, relaxed fashion, and love for spontaneity. Read more
