                <h3>About Hipsters</h3>
                <p>
                    A hipster is often defined as a subcultural figure who values
            independent thinking, counter-culture, and non-mainstream interests.
            The modern hipster movement took shape in the 2000s, especially
            among urban, young adults. Hipsters tend to gravitate toward
            alternative fashion, music, art, and lifestyles that emphasize
            creativity and individuality. Their distinct aesthetic often
            includes thrift-store clothing, vintage styles, and accessories that
            may seem ironic or retro, signaling a rejection of mass-market
            consumerism.

                <h3>History of Hipsterism</h3>
                <p>
                    The origins of hipsterism can be traced back to the 1940s in the
            United States, where the term "hipster" was first used to describe
            jazz aficionados who adopted the laid-back, rebellious lifestyle of
            African-American jazz musicians. These early hipsters embraced the
            subversive spirit of jazz, which stood in contrast to the mainstream
            culture of the time, and were characterized by their bohemian
            attitudes, relaxed fashion, and love for spontaneity. Read more

                    Hipster music is characterized by a preference for independent,
            alternative, and non-mainstream sounds. Rooted in a desire to

            toward indie rock, folk, electronic, and experimental genres. Read
