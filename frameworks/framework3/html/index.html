      This weeks featured game is Dark Souls III a game of valleys and peaks,
      down through dungeons and up over castle walls. It's a plummet into places
      we shouldn't be, an escape from places we don't belong.
      <br />
      <br />
      But of course, we fight our way through the darkness, and find our way
      out. There are a few stumbles along the way, but in the end, Dark Souls
      III is well worth the riveting climb. Final Fantasy 15 will launch on
      September 30, 2016 publisher Square Enix has announced. The date was
      revealed during the Uncovered: Final Fantasy XV event, which is being held
