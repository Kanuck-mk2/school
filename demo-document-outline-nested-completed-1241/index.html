                <h3>Instructions:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar
                        until light and fluffy.</li>
                    <li>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
                    <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
                    <li>Gradually add the dry ingredient mixture to the creamed butter and sugar mixture, stirring well
                        after each addition.</li>
                    <li>Gently fold in the chocolate chips until they are evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
                    <li>Cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Chilling the dough helps
                        the cookies retain their shape while baking and enhances the flavor.</li>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C) and line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone mats.
                    </li>
                    <li>Remove the chilled dough from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for a few
                        minutes to soften slightly.</li>
                    <li>Scoop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches
                        apart.</li>
                    <li>Bake for 10-12 minutes or until the edges are golden brown. The centers may still look slightly
                        soft, but they will firm up as the cookies cool.</li>
                    <li>Remove from the oven and let the cookies cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes, then transfer
                        them to wire racks to cool completely.</li>
                    <li>Store any leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week. To maintain
                        their freshness, you can also store them in the refrigerator or freeze them for longer storage.
                    </li>
                </ol>

            <h2>FAQs about Chocolate Chip Cookies</h2>
            <section>
                <h3>How do I make my chocolate chip cookies soft and chewy?</h3>
                <p>To achieve soft and chewy chocolate chip cookies, make sure to use enough moisture in your dough,
                    such as using brown sugar, which contains more moisture than white sugar. Additionally, avoid
                    overbaking the cookies, as they will continue to cook slightly while cooling on the baking sheet.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h3>Can I substitute ingredients in a chocolate chip cookie recipe?</h3>
                <p>Yes, you can make substitutions based on your preferences or dietary needs. For example, you can use
                    margarine instead of butter, or a gluten-free flour blend instead of all-purpose flour. However,
                    keep in mind that substitutions may affect the texture and taste of the cookies.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Can you bake chocolate chip cookie dough from frozen?</h3>
                <p>I have tested baking this recipe from frozen more times than I can even count. I have gotten the best
                    results when I place the dough on a parchment lined baking sheet.
                    Then, preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (ONLY if you are baking the frozen dough) and put
                    the cookies in the oven in the beginning of the preheating time. Set the timer for 15 minutes and
                    remove the cookies after 15 minutes. The top will look a little more brown than usual, but they will
                    still taste amazing.</p>
